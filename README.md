# WIP Elm bundle

This bundle did much more in its previous version.

One of the tools that it used (`elm-oracle`) got deprecated and
does not support the latest Elm 1.19.1 version anymore.
Because of this I've removed the features that it
provided.

The only remaining feature right now is syntax highlighting.

My Elm is a bit rusty, as I haven't used it for a long time.
I'll be improving and adding features as I get back into it.

## Installation
1. `cd ~/.howl/bundles`
2. `git clone https://github.com/rokf/howl-elm`
